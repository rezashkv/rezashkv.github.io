 I am a PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.umd.edu) at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://umd.edu). Currently, I am under advised by [Dr. Heng Huang](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~heng/).
My research interests are in the areas of machine learning and computer vision. I am particularly interested in developing efficient and robust deep learning models for visual recognition tasks.
Prior to joining UMD, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from [Sharif University of Technology](http://www.en.sharif.edu). I also worked in the industry as a Data Scientist for two years.
